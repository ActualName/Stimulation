# Force-of-Contraction

Arduino-based algorithm for stimulating cardiac tissues. 

* S1 - regular stimulation which provides indefinite stimulation at user defined cycle length and pulse width. 
* S1S2 - dynamic stimulation which provides stimulation at user defined cycle length 1 for a defined number of beats, followed by stimulation at cycle legnth 2. Otherwise, will stimulate at cycle length 1 indefinitely if beats is undefined (NA)
